I graduated from National Taiwan University (NTU) with a BS in [Computer Science & Information Engineering](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/) (CSIE). I'm studying MS in [Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) (UCLA), and now seeking for a SWE full-time opportunity related to system, network, backend, and machine learning engineer role. I am familiar with C, C++, CUDA C, Python, Java, and interested in CS related techniques and knowledge.

I have Computer Vision background. I was a data engineer intern at Graphen, a start up company endeavoring in AI-related products. I was in the robotic team, helping my supervisor solve some CV problems, such as pattern recognition, SLAM simulation, and fisheye camera undistortion. Now I join the New York Graphen to deal with face expression recognition, model robustness, and performance enhancement.

I also collaborated with [Win Chou](https://www.winchiuwc.com/), developed the backend part for the [BizPro official website](https://bizpro-taipei.com/), and wrote CRUD APIs to support queries, updates, and maintenance. 

My research topic is Zen-NAS Applicability and Ability in Different Search Space, which is about Network Architecture Search. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chou-Song Chen](https://imp.iis.sinica.edu.tw/) of AI^2 Lab, NTU. I verified the applicable situation of Zen-NAS, and enhance the accuracy by replacing the random images in Zen-NAS to cifar100 images. You can see more in the [Research](yichunlo.github.io/research/).

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in the related topics.
