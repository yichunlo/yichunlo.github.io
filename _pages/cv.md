Education
======
* B.S. in Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, 2022
* M.S. in Computer and Information Science, University of California - Los Angeles, 2024 (expected)

Experience
======
* *Software Engineer Intern* \| **Graphen, Inc.**, New York, Jun. 2024 - Current

* *BizPro Official Website* \| **BizPro**, Taipei, Sep. 2022 - Feb. 2023
  * Crawled the membership data with PyMongo and efficiently resolved data format inconsistency by leveraging SQL and Python skills.
  * Developed the back-end system with Node.js and MongoDB; crafted efficient APIs for search, filter, and database management functionalities.
  * Developed an intuitive UI for the back-end system, empowering non-coders to efficiently manage and maintain the system, enhancing user experience and operational efficiency.

* *Data Engineer Intern* \| **Graphen, Inc.**, Taipei, Dec. 2021 - Nov. 2022
  * Addressed fisheye camera distortion by developing ROS packages with OpenCV, leveraging the fisheye camera's broader view to improve the accuracy of obstacle detection.
  * Configured the ROS docker environment and conducted robot simulation with TurtleBot3 SLAM and Gazebo to assess the applicability of the auto-tracking algorithm.
  * Developed C++ scripts to extract the robot pose from SLAM and made a progress in the auto-docking implementation.
  * Optimized YoloV4 models to achieve 95% precision and establish the pipeline integration with EacyOCR for license plate recognition.
  * Converted the YoloV4 model into ONNX format to promote compatibility between various deep learning frameworks, making the model capable of PyTorch.

* *Undergraduate Research Assistant* \| **AI^2 Lab**, Taipei, Dec. 2021 - Aug. 2022
  * Collaborated with two researchers to survey training-free Network Architecture Search (NAS) methods and designed experiments on Zen-NAS.
  * Adapted the NAS-Bench-201 API to conduct testing of Zen-NAS within the NAS-Bench-201 search space and analyzed the impact on different search spaces.
  * Utilized PyTorch and Numpy to replace random image input with the Cifar dataset and improved the top-1 accuracy on the Cifar100 dataset from 80.05% to 81.60% in Zen-NAS.

Coarsework
======
* **Distributed and Parallel Computing**
  * Applied OpenMP to achieve parallelization in matrix multiplication; designed loop tiling and permutation to utilize cache and resulted in 8 times speed up.
  * Utilized MPI APIs to communicate through each process, parallelizing the matrix multiplication by dividing the computation into sub-processes and get a 7 times speed up.
  * Designed implicit loops with CUDA C to parallelize CNN convolution process; utilized shared memory to reuse data and got a 12 times speed up.

* **System Programming**
  * Managed file locks to handle concurrent file access requests successfully in a multi-user environment.
  * Utilized fork() to create a bidding system and implemented the communication between parent and child processes.
  * Implemented a scheduler with setjmp(), longjmp(), mutex, and signals to do context switch, function access control, and multi-process control.

* **Computer Network**
  * Built a personal home page with c socket programming  and implemented functions such as comment, login/logout, and video playing.
  * Utilized the cookie to control user login, and encrypted the user account and password with md5.
  * Handled data streaming into chunks to play the video on the website.
